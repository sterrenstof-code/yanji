      <h1>STERRENSTOF</h1>
      <p>For my own website I wanted to show the simplicity and elegance that Sterrenstof stands for, whilst still showcasing the fun and unique capabilites of custom webdesign. Therefore I opted for the single window, a personal favorite, thus allowing an interesting juxtaposition between a minimalistic left side organised with essential information, and a unique approach to showcasing projects on the right hand side. Finally this contrast is overcome and returned back into its former simplicity by this section, where the user finds details about the distinct projects, as a place where the eye can rest and soak information. That way this website counts as a testemony that websites can be complex without having to sacrifise usefullness- and that not every site has to be a scrolling race to the bottom.</p>

  <p class="client">For this project I used HTML5, CSS3 and JS6. Most of the website is made with CSS, although JS is responsible for the viewport effects, the header changing color upon scroll, and the ´all´ section, which is a client side application that uses .filter and .map to manipulate the DOM. At the moment I am rebuilding this website into a working e-commerce site, with REST API´s and Node.js.</p>
